Worksheet C  
A) The algorithm checks if there is a duplicate letter in the list by going through the list in order to see if a letter is repeated, if a letter has a duplicate the result will be true. 
B) Because of the loop within the loop, so it has to check each item in the first list as well as each item in the second list so it will be N * N = N^2 
C) Because it still checks all the numbers but it doesn't check the last number because its been check already making it almost twice as fast. Eg : 1:2 1:1 2:2 2:1 
D) Because the first algorithm has to check it 100 times because of N^2 where as this one only has to do one less loop per number which means itâ€™s a lot faster. 
E) No because the number of times is not N^2 anymore because there is one less loop is has to check. 
F) O(n log n) - Time Complexity https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity 
G) O(N^2 Log N)because you multiply the time complexity of the sort function which is O(n log n) by the loop time complexity which is O(N)  
H) The first algorithm with N^2 will run faster because the values of O(N^2 Log N) get larger than that the original one 
I) If they are making a short list with not a lot of values
